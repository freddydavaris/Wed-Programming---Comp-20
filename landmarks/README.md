#Landmarks


1. Used the JavaScript XMLHttpRequest object to make requests, JavaScript navigator.geolocation object to retrieve my geolocation information, used a datastore API to send my location and receive information regarding my surrounding landmarks and location of other students, implemented a Google Maps API. 

2. Worked by myself. Used code from "http://stackoverflow.com/questions/14560999/using-the-haversine-formula-in-javascript" and "https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/javascript/examples/polyline-simple" to calculate the distances and render a polyline between myself and the closest landmark. Finally, consulted and modified the Google maps example "https://github.com/tuftsdev/WebProgramming/blob/gh-pages/examples/google_maps/gmap_api_example.html"

3. 8-10 hours to figure out everything and implement it.
