Responsive Window


1. The use of the "media" helped me correctly implement tha responsive window assignment using one sprite, and therefore only by choosing the specific part of the sprite i was able to present a "slideshow" while adjusting the window length. 
2. No one collaborated with me for this assignment.
3. Including the online research prior to starting the project this assignment took around 3-4 hours in total.
